## Common iOS Issues & Solutions

### Issue: App doesn't install as PWA
**Solution**: Ensure manifest.json is valid and icons are properly sized

### Issue: White space at top/bottom
**Solution**: Check safe area insets and viewport height CSS

### Issue: Input fields zoom on focus
**Solution**: Set font-size to 16px minimum

### Issue: Touch interactions feel laggy
**Solution**: Use CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties

### Issue: Keyboard covers input fields
**Solution**: Implement scroll-into-view on focus

- [ ] CORS headers configured if needed

### 2. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Images optimized for mobile
- [ ] CSS/JS minified for production
- [ ] Service worker caching strategy tested
- [ ] Bundle size optimized

### 3. Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking implemented
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] User analytics (optional)
- [ ] Crash reporting (optional)

## Testing Commands

### Local Testing

# Start the development server
npm start

# Test with HTTPS (required for PWA)
# Use ngrok or similar tool for HTTPS testing
```

### Production Testing
```bash

npm run build
npm run serve
```

## iOS-Specific Debugging

### Safari Web Inspector
1. Enable Developer menu in Safari
2. Connect iOS device via USB

```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics

- First Input Delay: < 100ms

### Testing Tools
- Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)
- WebPageTest
- iOS Safari Web Inspector

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. PWA installation rate
2. User engagement in standalone mode
3. Performance metrics
4. Error rates
5. User feedback

### Monitoring Tools
- Google Analytics
- Sentry (error tracking)
- Firebase Performance
- Custom analytics

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Updates

## Quick Test Checklist

Before releasing, quickly test these key areas:

1. **Installation**: Can users add to home screen?
2. **Functionality**: Do all features work in standalone mode?
3. **Performance**: Is the app responsive and fast?
4. **UI/UX**: Does it feel native on iOS?
5. **Offline**: Does basic functionality work offline?

If all items pass, the app is ready for iOS testing! ðŸš€
